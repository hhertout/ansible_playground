# This role aim to generate SSH key pair required to enable the SSH connection between the ansible controller and the targeted machines.
# It can generate the keys on the host controller or copy them from the ansible vault. >group_vars/all/ssh.vault.yml
#
# It aim to generate the keys on the controller... not on the targeted machine.
# For obvious security reasons, the private key should never be copied to the targeted machine.
# The public key is the only one that should be copied to the targeted machine.
# The private key should be stored in a safe place, like a password manager or a vault.
